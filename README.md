# Blog_Website

Developed a blog themed website using Angular, making the user interface useable and scalable. It uses a back-end API to manage the blog posts in MongoDB as well as wire up our app to use a single service to manage the data. In this application, user can add and delete the posts, comment on posts, and track the number of views per post.
